  "summary": "Most requested storefront changes appear to be implemented: duration is constrained to “1 Month”, catalog expanded with the specified new services and generated-asset image paths, Messenger group link added in the Footer, pricing is gated via an `isPriced` flag (Netflix + Chess priced; others inquiry-only), and Chess.com logo path updated to the requested generated filename. One unrelated footer attribution/link appears to have been added without being requested.",
